                    <h3>Painting</h3>
                    <p>Painting, especially with watercolors, is my favorite creative outlet. I love the way watercolors blend and flow, creating soft, vibrant, and unpredictable textures. Most of my inspiration comes from nature—sunsets, landscapes, and flowers often find their way onto my canvas.</p>
                    <p>Besides being an artistic expression, painting helps me unwind and enhances my focus. It’s incredibly satisfying to turn a blank page into a vibrant masterpiece, even if it’s just for myself. I believe art is not about perfection but about enjoying the process.</p>

                    <h3>Classic Literature</h3>
                    <p>Books have been a constant companion throughout my life, and I find particular joy in classic literature. Works like *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen, *Crime and Punishment* by Fyodor Dostoevsky, and *1984* by George Orwell captivate me with their depth and insight.</p>
                    <p>Reading these classics allows me to travel through time and immerse myself in different eras, cultures, and philosophies. Beyond the stories, I enjoy analyzing the themes, characters, and societal critiques embedded in the text. Books fuel my curiosity and inspire me to write my own thoughts.</p>

                    <p>Music has been an integral part of my daily life, whether I’m working, relaxing, or looking for inspiration. I enjoy exploring various genres, from the intricate harmonies of classical symphonies to the upbeat rhythms of indie and pop tracks.</p>
                    <p>Listening to music helps me connect with emotions and memories. It serves as a backdrop to both my highs and lows, making every moment more vivid. Here's one of my favorite tracks:</p>
