                <p>I am a passionate developer and designer who thrives on blending creativity with functionality. Whether it’s building intuitive systems or collaborating on innovative projects, I’m driven by a love for problem-solving and continuous learning.

                </ul>
                <p>These principles shape my approach to every project, whether it’s designing user-centered systems, collaborating on team-based tasks, or striving for excellence in my studies. They motivate me to push boundaries, learn continuously, and contribute to innovations that truly matter.</p>
